#### Chapter 1 - Developing Simple Applications


##### Version 0.0.1
The code for this version is in the file: game_v0.py. 
The player can choose to enter a hut by inputting a number between 1 and 5. Then, based on whether there is an 'enemy', or 'friend' inside the hut or if the hut is 'unoccupied', the player either loses or wins.  

**WIN Condition**
Enter an unoccupied or friendly hut. 

**LOSE Condition**
Enter an enemy hut. 


##### Version 0.0.5
This version makes the code modular, and adds the combat ability.

`show_theme_message, show_game_mission, occupy_huts, process_user_choice, reveal_occupants, enter_hut`
